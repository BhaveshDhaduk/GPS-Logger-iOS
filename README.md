GPS Logger for iOS
==================

This app is an experiment at gathering data from an iPhone to test the Core Location API and its various settings. The app tracks:
* GPS location
* Motion State (walking, running, driving, cycling, stationary)
* Battery level

The app gathers data with no network connection and stores locally on disk. The data is sent to the server in a batch at an interval set by the user.

There are many settings available in the settings tab which allow you to adjust properties of the Core Location API.

## API

The app will post the location data to the configured endpoint. The POST request will be an array of GeoJSON objects inside a property called "locations". This may look like the following:

```
{
  "locations": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": {
          "latitude": 37.331800,
          "longitude": -122.030581
        }
      },
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": "2015-10-01T08:00:00-0700",
        "altitude": 0,
        "speed": 4,
        "horizontal_accuracy": 30,
        "vertical_accuracy": -1,
        "motion": ["driving","stationary"],
        "pauses": false,
        "activity": "other_navigation",
        "desired_accuracy": 100,
        "deferred": 1000,
        "significant_change": "disabled",
        "locations_in_payload": 1,
        "battery_state": "charging",
        "battery_level": 0.89
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The properties on the location object are as follows:

* `timestamp` - the ISO8601 timestamp of the `CLLocation` object recorded
* `altitude` - the altitude of the location in meters
* `speed` - meters per second
* `horizontal_accuracy` - accuracy of the position in meters
* `vertical_accuracy` - accuracy of the altitude in meters
* `motion` - an array of motion states detected by the motion coprocessor. Possible values are: `driving`, `walking`, `running`, `cycling`, `stationary`. A common combination is `driving` and `stationary` when the phone is resting on the dashboard of a moving car.
* `pauses` - boolean, whether the "pause updates automatically" preference is checked
* `activity` - a string denoting the type of activity as indicated by the setting. Possible values are `automotive_navigation`, `fitness`, `other_navigation` and `other`. This can be set on the settings screen.
* `desired_accuracy` - the requested accuracy in meters as configured on the settings screen.
* `deferred` - the distance in meters to defer location updates, configured on the settings screen.
* `significant_change` - a string indicating the significant change mode, `disabled`, `enabled` or `exclusive`.
* `locations_in_payload` - the number of locations that were sent in the batch along with this location
* `battery_state` - `unknown`, `charging`, `full`, `unplugged`
* `battery_level` - a value from 0 to 1 indicating the percent battery remaining.
